## Corrected submission

* This submission includes corrections to the DESCRIPTION file and the removal of an example per the editor's feedback on my original submission for the package. I added '' around the package name in the description field and removed the ! in the title.
* Subsequent to my original submission I made an improvement to the package so this is now submitting version 0.1.1 instead of 0.1.0. I have re-tested it on all of the environments mentioned below.
* From my original submission: I believe everything should be in order. There is no vignette because I do not believe it could be created without my specific API credentials included. The examples and README both demonstrate how the package would be used by someone who is a customer for this service and has the proper authentication credentials.
  
## Test environments

* Developed on and tested with Windows 10 and R 3.6.
* Tested on R-devel with devtools::check_win_devel().
* Testing against multiple Linux platforms with devtools::check_rhub().
